## DESCRIPTION
A study project for Epicodus Android course. 
This is an android app using Firebase database and Yelp API (V2). 
A user creates a profile and looks restaurants up by a zip code. 
The user then can save restaurants and see a list of them on another page. 
You can go to the restaurant's profile on Yelp, call the restaurant and see it on the map from the restaurant detail page. 
The app supports vertical and horizontal layouts. 
The fun part is you can take pictures with the app and store your custom pictures instead of those provided by Yelp.
